- narrow types from filter
- leak checker / operator graph viewer
- useNewView lint?
  - useQuery instead of useNewView? query <=> view
- unmaterialized variant of useQuery?
  - or update virtual table to take materialized variant?
- distinct count
- // TODO: re-order view vs value return
- hoist comparator up the chain and materialize using source comparator as default comparator if it still exists
- better destructing... TaskTable2 for example.
- `.value` rather than `materializeValue`?
- `useQuery` rather than `useNewView`? Materializes to default structure?
- BUG: dissassociation from data and queries??
